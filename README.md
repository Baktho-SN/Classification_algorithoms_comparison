# Classification_algorithoms_comparison

I compared 6 different classification algorithms on two different datasets 

## Made with


![python 3.11.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-blue.svg)
![numpy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Numpy-777BB4?logo=numpy&logoColor=white)
![pandas](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pandas-2C2D72?logo=pandas&logoColor=white)
![scikit-learn](https://img.shields.io/badge/Scikit_learn-0078D4?logo=scikit-learn&logoColor=white)

## Datasets used



1 Heart Failure Analysis

2 Diabeties Predictor



## Algorithms used


1 Logistic Regression

2 SVC

3 KNN

4 Decision Tree

5 Random Forest

6 Naive Bayes


### Results: 


Random forest performed well in both datasets with highest accuracy, recall, precision and F1 score.

This goes to show how powerful ensemble algorithms are,

Though there maybe better and more efficient algorithms in certain situations
